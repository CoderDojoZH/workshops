# Workshops

There are a few "unasked questions" that we could answer to the kids (just a brainstorming / draft for now):

- How can they use a computer in a more "active" way?
- What can I do with my computer?
- What do I have to learn to be a programmer?
- What have I learned?
- How can I start my own project?
- How can I participate in other's people projects?

Remarks:

- The answers could be different for different ages and backgrounds.
