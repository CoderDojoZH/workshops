# The wiggling snake

This project documents step by step how to create a snake that wiggles following the mouse cursor.

It is inspired by the [floating orca](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/16795490/] by NickyNouse

## Making it doable

The original floating orca looks like this

has 45 costumes which manage to give a 3D view of the orca.

In our project we will simplify the task and aim at a 2D snake wiggling around.

The scripts NickyNouse has created for his orca are a bit dense. We will go through them step by step:

-

-

## Following the mouse cursor

## Following the mouse, DIY

## Draw a simple figure

- costumes

## Cloning the costumes

## Getting the costumes to be skewed

## Getting a nice snake

## Learning goals


- simplify the project
- define doable steps
- gently moving a sprite to a specific point
