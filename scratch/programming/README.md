## Let the computer understand your thoughts

Getting computers to help us to solve problems is a two-step process:

1. First, we think about the steps needed to solve a problem. 
2. Then, we use our technical skills to get the computer working on the problem. 

Take something as simple as using a calculator to solve a word problem in maths. First, you have to understand and interpret the problem _before_ the calculator can help out with the arithmetic bit. 

Computational thinking is _not_ thinking about computers or like computers. Computers don’t think for themselves. Not yet, at least! 

Computational thinking is about looking at a problem in a way that a computer can help us to solve it.

When we do computational thinking, we use the following processes to tackle a problem: 

- Logical reasoning: predicting and analysing 
- Algorithms: making steps and rules
- Decomposition: breaking down into parts 
- Abstraction: removing unnecessary detail 
- Patterns and generalisation: spotting and using similarities
- Evaluation: making judgements

The thinking processes and approaches that help with computing are really useful in many other domains too:

- you take a complex problem and break it down into smaller problems
- it’s necessary to work out the steps or rules for getting things done
- the complexity of the task needs to be managed, typically by focusing on the key details 
- the way previous projects have been accomplished can help. 

## Logical reasoning

### Classroom activity ideas 

- Provide pupils with floor turtles and ask them to make predictions of where the robot will end up when the go button is pressed. Then ask them to explain why they think that. Being able to give a reason for their thinking is what using logical reasoning is all about.
- In their own coding, logical reasoning is key to debugging (finding and fixing the mistakes in their programs). Ask the pupils to look at one another’s Scratch programs and spot bugs. Encourage them to test the programs to see if they can isolate exactly which bit of code is causing a problem. If pupils’ programs fail to work, get them to explain their code to a friend or even an inanimate object (e.g. a rubber duck).
- Give pupils a program of your own or from the Scratch community sites and ask them to work backwards from the code to work out what it will do.
- There are many games, both computer-based and more traditional, that draw directly on the ability to make logical predictions. Organise for the pupils to play noughts and crosses using pencil and paper. As they are playing, ask them to predict their opponent’s next move. Let them play computer games such as Minesweeper, Angry Birds or SimCity, as appropriate. Ask them to pause at certain points and tell you what they think will happen when they move next.
