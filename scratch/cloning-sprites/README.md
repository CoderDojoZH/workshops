# Cloning Sprites

If you have multiple items that are very similar it can be worth use the script to clone a single sprite rather than creating lot of sprites.

If the items do not look all the same, you can set their look by using costumes.

This way, it's easier to test if a sprite is interacting with any of the cloned sprites.
