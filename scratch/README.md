# Blocks of code to create
## Move/Steering
How the character can move in different directions.  
1. Key is pressed and character moves several steps. Sprite moves only if key is pressed/held
2. Key is pressed and character starts moving in a given direction. Sprite moves after releasing a key.

## Turns left/right

## Jumping
1. Jump upwards
2. Jump diagonally

## Hit a wall - Bartosz takes it over
1. When wall is hit, stop the character
2. When wall is hit, bounce the character

## Hit an object
1. When object is hit, bounce
2. When object is hit, do some interaction
  a. change color
  b. send message
  c. move

## Throw an object
As a result of some event an object can be created and thrown

## Frequency of key presses
How often is a key pressed in some short amount of time.
Eg. for olympic games: if there are enough presses per second, then the character moves faster

## Animate sprites
Change costumes when character moves. Change direction of a character during movement.
1. The character can be increased permanently (eg. Mario)
2. Sprite can pulse several times to catch attention
3. Sprite can shake either to sides or with small turns 

## Count points
This may be needed for several players

## Display something on start of the game
Eg. 3 2 1 Start

## Scrolling background
I am not sure if it is possible and would consider it a secondary target.

## Scrolling sprites
This can be useful for "go to right" games.
