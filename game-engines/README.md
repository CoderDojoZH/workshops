# Game engines

We are looking for a game engine that we can use to introduce our kids to "real" programming.

The game engines should be free and multiplatform (at least Linux, OS X and Windows).

- Godot
- Kivy
- Panda3D
- Cafu Engine
- Cocos2d
- Delta3D
- GamePlay
- Gamvas
- OGRE
- PlayCanvas
- Starling
- ZGameEditor

We should define some criteria for evaluating / triage the available game engines.
