"A text editor is a program used for editing plain text files." ([Wikipedia: Text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor).

Differently from word processors like _Libre Office Write_ or _Microsoft Word_, text editors create and edit files containg text without any formatting (boldface, italics, fonts, tables, ...).

When programming, you can use one of the many text editors that are specialized for programming that you find listed in the Getting started chapter for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. (TODO: set the link)

Among other things allo of the listed text editors will highlight the syntax of your code, help you correctly indent it and offer search and replace functions.

An alternative is to use an [Integrated Development Environment](glossary#IDE) (IDE).

## <a name="rgb-color"></a>RGB colors

In LÃ–VE colors are composed by degrees of red, green and blue]: the yre defined as RGB colors.

As you might have learned in school, mixing lot of the base colors will give you white.  
255 being the maximum we can set, `255, 255, 255` will give you the color white.

You might guess that `255, 0 0` will give a red, `0, 255, 0` a green, `0, 0, 255` a blue, `0, 0, 0` and all the values inbetween "some" more or less surprising color.

You can find tools to calculate the values for any color in all drawing programs and also by searching in the internet.
