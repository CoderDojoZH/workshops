This manuals will help you create your first game with Lua and LÖVE.

LÖVE is a framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua.

It has a short learning curve and you can start developing immediately.

It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The latest versions also work on Android and iOS.

TODO: add screenshosts from the games (multiple per game?) on http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-learn-love-love2d--gamedev-4331 and on the löve site.
