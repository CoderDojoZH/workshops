# Getting started

This manual helps you create your first game with Lua and LÖVE.

It's not an introduction to programming, it won't teach you Lua or present you every LÖVE feature. It will try to hold your hand while you'll crete your first game.

And your first game will be what is called a "scrolling shooter" game. A typical form of game where you throw things at other things that are falling down and move left and right to avoid getting hit.

In our tutorial, we will have a Fireboat that spits water at flames falling down from the sky, but you can replace the objects (or [sprites](glossary#sprite) as they are mostly called) with your own.


TODO: add screenshosts from the games (multiple per game?) on http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-learn-love-love2d--gamedev-4331 and on the löve site.

# What is Löve

LÖVE is a framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua.

Lua and LÖVE have a short learning curve and you can start developing immediately.

It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The latest versions also work on Android and iOS.
