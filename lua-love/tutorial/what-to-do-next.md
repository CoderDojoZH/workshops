# What to do next?

- Mirror the boat when turning left / right
- Create and render an animated "burning ship" image that is shown when the boat is on fire (instead of simply hiding it).
- Learning more Lua: you only have learned very little about Lua, you might want to also go through the [Learnign more Lua](tutorial/learning-more-lua.md) chapter.
- Making the game playable on mobile (a touch interface without keyboard keys) and loading it to a mobile device with Android or iOS.
